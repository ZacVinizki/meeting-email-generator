        Hi Aidan,

 

Thanks for the time today ‚Äì exciting times for you!  Keep it going.

 

I thought it would be helpful to follow up with some notes to help with your understanding and to make sure we are on the same page.  

 

Please review and provide feedback, as necessary.

Participants: Aidan Harradence and James Telfser via Teams Meeting.

Objective: 1) Get caught up ; 2) Review Portfolio; 3) Discuss changes to the portfolio based on market conditions & current lifestyle.

 

Key Takeaways:

Investment Accounts:
Performance has improved this year with accounts up ~20% after fees.  
It‚Äôs been a great year for small/mid cap stocks, and we were waiting on this rebound to rebalance the account which is great (ie. we did not sell at the lows).
We have been raising some cash ($20k) throughout the year to diversify the account into less volatile investments.
We talked about ETFs and how we will be utilizing these more going forward to take advantage of ‚Äútime arbitrage‚Äù.
Planning & Personal:
You are currently living in the UK and are pursuing an entrepreneurial venture in the film industry (very cool!).  
You currently have ~5-6 months of living expenses covered assuming you do take on any part time work.
You do not expect to require any of these savings, but would like to keep some in cash as a back up (~$20k).
You reiterated that you are still a beginner when it comes to investing and would like some book recommendations (we have these all in the office next time you are here:
A Random Walk Down Wall Street
Rich Dad Poor Dad
The Psychology of Money
Reporting:
You would like a login for NDEX/NBIN+
You would like to set up a recurring quarterly check in, especially given that you are trying to learn and may require additional income.
Next Steps:

Action Items:
You will review what your CRA details say online about what you can contribute to your TFSA.
James to send an email with an updated asset allocation and changes to the accounts incorporating your updated information and desire for less volatility.
Katherine will send over login details for our systems so you can track the accounts.
 

All the best,
James

Heres another-

Hi everyone,


It was great to see you all yesterday.  Please see below for minutes and some additional details. 

 

As always, please let me know if I have missed anything or if you have any questions.


All the best,
James

 

Participants: Brad Jarvis (BJ), Faye Wardrop (FW), Steve Barlow (SB) and James Telfser (JT) ‚Äì Victoria in person

Objective: 1) Quarterly Account Review;  2) Market Outlook

 

Key Takeaways:

Quarterly Review:
We discussed performance, asset allocation and recent changes.  Overall, Jarvis Group of accounts was +1% in Q1-25.
Major contributors were gold, global equities ex-US, Canadian large cap equities and preferred shares.
Weakness was driven by the large cap US Equity ETFs as technology/consumer discretionary underperformed.
We remained within the Target Asset Allocation ranges as per our recent IPS.
We discussed the changes to the Aventine Funds ‚Äì Selling down the US Equity Fund (for more passive and fixed income exposure) & an eventual merger of the Aventine Canadian Equity Fund.
We currently have orders in to sell $200k ACE Fund and $450k of the US Equity Fund at April 30th, representing 4.5% additional cash. 
We discussed the NorthStream Credit Fund sell which settles early May ($425,000 or ~3% of the account)
We will hold a higher than normal cash position in the account, however we will add to fixed income & infrastructure (KKR) to round out the asset allocation. 
We discussed continuing to hold a higher percentage of cash/fixed income/gold which we all agreed was a good idea as we deal with the uncertainty at the moment.
We agreed that holding cash/money market, despite lower rates in CAD was the right decision given the volatility in currencies and goal of capital preservation, especially for downpayment cash.
IPS/KYC:
BJ has an offer on Saturna ($1.34mm less expenses) and is working towards a close in the coming months.
BJ also has an offer on one of the lots for $300k less expenses.
It is currently expected that BJ will require $1-$1.2mm in cash for downpayment on Salt Spring in addition to cash from the properties above (sometime in next 12 months)
JT to continue to be conservative with cash and keep enough liquidity for downpayment (currently $2.8mm in cash). 
Upon the withdrawal of the funds for downpayment, JT to rebalance to ensure that we remain in line with IPS targets and current market outlook.
Expenses for BJ seem to be a little higher than originally projected in our IPS from a couple years ago.
Next Steps:
JT to make asset allocation changes in Q2 once aforementioned trades settle in early May. 
JT to continue to build up the passive side of the accounts with proceeds from active mandates, however, will be more conservative than normal given current expectation for volatility and potential cash needs.
JT to include FW on any asset allocation or special investment opportunities communications. 
FW will ensure that the appropriate accounting/legal team is in the loop.
JT to follow up with BJ/FW regarding an updated IPS to incorporate new and more realistic spending targets. 
JT to offer up financial planning exercise to ensure current spending is sustainable under conservative assumptions.
BJ/FW to keep JT informed of any structural changes to the accounts or changes to investment criteria or eligibility.
Have a great day ahead!

James

this was more how he would write the email if it was to a 3rd party or a larg client not an individual investor:

heres a final example :

Hi Yvonne,


It was great to see you in person yesterday!  Let‚Äôs make sure to do that at least once per year üòä.  Look forward to hearing about your 4 generation(!) trip to NFLD.

 

Please see below for minutes and some additional details. 

 

As always, please let me know if I have missed anything or if you have any questions.

Participants: Yvonne Taylor (YT), James Telfser (JT) ‚Äì In Person

Objective: 1) YTD Account Review;  2) KYC Check up

 

Key Takeaways:

YTD Review:
We discussed performance, asset allocation and recent changes to the accounts and fund structures. Overall, your accounts are up ~1% in 2025, up just shy of 6% per year after fees since inception.  
Major contributors were preferred shares, Canadian large cap equities and global equities (IQLT ETF).  
Weakness was primarily driven by Apple (-20% YTD + USD weakness) and Transforce (-36% YTD).
We remained within the Target Asset Allocation ranges of 0-30% Cash,  15-35% Fixed Income, and 30-70% Equity.  We‚Äôve kept it simple without allocations to our alternatives sleeve.
We discussed the changes to the Aventine Funds ‚Äì Selling down the US Equity Fund (for more passive and fixed income exposure) & an eventual merger of the Aventine Canadian Equity Fund.
We currently have orders in to sell all but ~$1,000 of the ACE Fund at the end of June.  
We discussed the EM Flexible Fixed Income Fund and the other EM products.  JT made it clear we will not add additional Ewing Morris products.
We also walked through the conflicts of interest document.
We walked through the various ETFs and the benefits of holdings them (QQQ/HXQ = Tech w/o concentration risk, XIC/TSX = Broad Canada, resource exposure w/o having to pick, etc). 
Finally, we discussed the various fixed income ETFs and why we hold them.  Reasons include higher yield and view that the USD will appreciate vs CAD so could make 4% income and an additional 2-3% in currency appreciation.
IPS/KYC:
No change in financial position or asset allocation, currently receiving enough cash from the monthly RRIF payments.
Continue to manage account considering time horizon and avoid any illiquid investments.
No major purchases/withdrawals expected. 
Other/Next Steps:
JT to enter sell order for ACE/Darkhorse
JT reviewed TFSA contribution room, and you CAN contribute the $85,000 (deregistered in 2024) in 2025.
JT to contribute the AirBoss and Preferred Share position to shelter from taxes going forward.
JT to send Addepar login and upload presentation
Completed‚Ä¶please let me know if you have trouble logging in.  
Have a great day ahead!
